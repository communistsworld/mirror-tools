<h1>red texts mirror</h1>
<p>This site serves as a mirror to the <a href="https://www.redtexts.org/"><em>red texts: communist text files</em> archive</a>. For more information on the actual project, visit their site.</p>
<p>Besides just re-hosting the texts from <em>red texts</em> this mirror also has converted each of these into different formats, listed in the table below.</p>
<p>The actual text files are stored within a <a href="https://github.com/xatasan/rt-texts">public git repository</a>, meaning anyone can easily contribute, add texts, fix typos, update changes, etc. Furthermore creating a mirror just like this one can be easily done with the <a href="https://github.com/xatasan/rt-mirror">mirror tools</a>. Due to the relative obscurity of some of these texts, but interesting content, I urge anyone with some spare server space and interest to host these documents. It can all be set up within a matter of minutes. If you do so, feel free to contact <a href="..">me</a>, and I will add your archive to this page.</p>
